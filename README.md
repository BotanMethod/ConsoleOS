# This is my own OS, that made in console with python.

It's open source! You can do anything with ConsoleOS!

## One thing you should do before changing ConsoleOS:
Download the latest release and unzip the files to the folder where you will work with the ConsoleOS (You can go to another folder using the "cd" command)

## WARNING!
At the time of **23/10/2024**, this OS does NOT work on **Linux**, only on **Windows 7, 8, 8.1, 10, 11**. 
I'm trying to fix this problem, so, Linux users, wait.
